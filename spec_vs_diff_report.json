  "summary": "Control Center page, route, and TopNav entry were added along with an admin guard and an App Configuration section. Admin operations appear consolidated into a new tabbed component. However, at least two acceptance criteria are not met based on the diff: transporter unassignment from the assignment workflow is explicitly unsupported, and bottom-ad settings are still localStorage-based rather than a single persisted source of truth.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "From the Control Center, an admin can assign/unassign transporters to loads using the existing assign transporter workflow UI.",
      "reason": "The implemented assignment control explicitly states that unassignment is not supported and disables the \"Unassigned\" option, which conflicts with the unassign requirement.",

      "requirement": "Bottom ad settings can be controlled from the Control Center via a single source of truth (persisted and reloadable), rather than being device-only localStorage.",
      "reason": "The Control Center App Configuration section reads/saves bottom ad settings via getAdSettings/saveAdSettings from a local config module, and even dispatches a client-side window event, indicating it remains local/browser storage rather than a centralized persisted source of truth.",
