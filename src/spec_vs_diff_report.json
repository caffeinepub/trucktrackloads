  "summary": "Most requested features appear to be implemented: DRC added to at least About + Footer coverage text, contract details added to client/transporter registration and backend types, admin dashboard now includes spreadsheet-style client/transporter views with CSV export utilities, and an APK link setting is added. However, the backend APK link getter is not admin-restricted as required, and some implemented additions (e.g., contract start/end dates, ad settings/brand/contact changes) were not explicitly requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-42",
      "requirement": "Backend provides admin-only methods to get and set the APK download URL (stored persistently in canister state).",
      "reason": "The diff shows `setAndroidApkLink` enforcing admin authorization, but `getAndroidApkLink` has no admin check and is callable by anyone. This violates the 'admin-only methods to get and set' requirement (at least for the getter).",
