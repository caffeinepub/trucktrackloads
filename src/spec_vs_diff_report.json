  "summary": "Diff clearly implements frontend Years management UI, Contracts year selection/filtering, load model changes (price/status/client/assignedTransporter) including a migration module, and a new earth-tone theme. The diff also includes several additional admin/contact-message and navigation-related UI changes not requested in the BuildRequest. Backend API-level fulfillment for some requirements (approved-loads-with-IDs API, years add/remove/list APIs, contract post/get changes) cannot be fully verified from the truncated `backend/main.mo` excerpt.",
