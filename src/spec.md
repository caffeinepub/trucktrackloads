# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore a visible Admin entry point in the public UI so users can access the existing admin login page.

**Planned changes:**
- Add an "Admin" (or "Admin Login") link to the desktop top navigation that routes to `/admin/login`.
- Add the same "Admin" (or "Admin Login") link to the mobile navigation that routes to `/admin/login`.
- Add an "Admin" (or "Admin Login") link to the footer Quick Links that routes to `/admin/login`.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can find and open the Admin login page from the site’s desktop navigation, mobile navigation, and footer Quick Links, without changing any existing admin route behavior.
